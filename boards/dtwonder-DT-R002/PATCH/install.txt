I had success copying the driver from ESPHome (https://github.com/esphome/esphome/blob/dev/esphome/components/ethernet/esp_eth_phy_jl1101.c) 
into esp-idf/components/esp_eth/src, 

adding the source to esp-idf/components/esp_eth/CMakeLists.txt 
and also adding the prototype of esp_eth_phy_new_jl1101() to esp-idf/components/esp_eth/inlude/esp_eth_phy.h.

/**
* @brief Create a PHY instance of JL1101
*
* @param[in] config: configuration of PHY
*
* @return
*      - instance: create PHY instance successfully
*      - NULL: create PHY instance failed because some error occurred
*/
esp_eth_phy_new_jl1101()



The configuration pins were also borrowed from ESPHome and replicated to my MicroPython build:

lan = network.LAN(mdc=Pin(23), mdio=Pin(18), power=Pin(0), phy_addr=1, phy_type=network.PHY_JL1101, ref_clk=Pin(17), ref_clk_mode=Pin.OUT)
